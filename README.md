Machine Learning Introduction
-----------------------------

Basic machine learning presentation I did sometime ago. 

Easiest way to try this out on Windows is to use [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.org)

Demonstrates a bunch of things including:

* Classification
* Regression
* Plotting Learning Curves
* Comparing models
* Cross-validation
* How to use model from outside of scikit-learn
* Deep Learning using keras
* Visualization
